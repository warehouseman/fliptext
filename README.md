# fliptext

# Synopsis
A trivial jQuery plugin for printing text upside down.
Demonstrates creating and tiny-testing a bare minimum Meteor package.

# Purpose
The real purpose of this package is to provide the simplest possible self-standing Meteor package that shows correctly :

 - the structure of a working Meteor package
 - inclusion of a working jQuery plugin   (Currently, I have the plugin working in the package, but not in an ordinary web page)
 - a valid Travis CI build project
 - how to test with Tiny Test

When built into its accompanying demo app, it also shows correctly :

 - testing with Velocity and Cucumber
 - working in a browser
 - working in an Android phone

## Usage :
There are two ways to see this in action :

  1. Run its intenal test script.
  2. Clone it's accompanying demo Meteor app - "fliptext-demo" and run the app's intenal test script.

## Comment

Possibly you will look at this and think, "Sheesh, nuthin' to it!".

In fact, to get to this point, it took me about a week of sifting through documentation, watching videos and reading blog posts and Q & A forums (too much of which is obsolete).

It is a bare-minimum skeleton that actually works.

The tiny amount of code attests to the power and time-saving possibilities of Meteor -- **once you know what you are doing!**
